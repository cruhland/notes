# [DOM Living Standard](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/)

## Goals

Explains how the document standardizes the DOM.

## 1 Conformance

Specific requirements for implementations to be conforming. A summary:

- Normativity
    - All diagrams, examples, and notes in the document are
    non-normative
    - All sections explicitly stated as non-normative are
    non-normative
    - Everything else is normative
- This specification conforms to RFC 2119
- Imperative statements in algorithms should be read as including the
same RFC 2119 keyword that was used to introduce the algorithm.
- Algorithms may be implemented in any way, as long as the same
results are produced
- Implementations may impose limits on inputs not specified to have
them
- Calls to methods or attributes from user agent code must invoke an
internal API, rather than the user-facing JavaScript code, which can
be overridden.
- String comparison is case-sensitive.
