# sbt Reference Manual

Notes taken while reading [the documentation](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/index.html).

## Summary of contents

1. [General Information](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/General-Info.html)

    > This part of the documentation has project “meta-information” such as where to get help, find source code and how to contribute.

1. [Detailed Topics](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Detailed-Topics.html)

    This appears to be the meaty section of the manual, with information about features of sbt.

1. [Developer's Guide (Work in Progress)](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Developers-Guide.html)

    Information relevant to plugin authors and developers working on sbt itself. Not useful to me quite yet.

1. [How to...](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Howto.html)

    Very thorough listing of useful tasks and how to achieve them in sbt. This is definitely worth a closer read.

1. [Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Faq.html)

    As expected, a short guide to the most common questions. Should be valuable.

1. [Index](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Name-Index.html)

    A handy "cheat sheet" of the most common names, symbols, and objects that are used in a build defintion.
